        As the final regular season, Chris' Taskmaster 9 is easily the best so far. With the stakes at an all time high, former contestants Sterling, 
        Fisher, Tyler, and Fudge make one last face off against two new to the series contestants, Jonah King and Gorilla. With 6 competitors hoping for 
        the last spot in Champion of Champions 3 to hopefully squeak into the finale, anything is possible in this greatest season yet.
